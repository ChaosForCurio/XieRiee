Next.js Project Overview

This project was initialized using create-next-app
 and follows the recommended Next.js App Router structure.

🚀 Getting Started

Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser.

You can begin customizing the app by editing app/page.tsx. Changes will automatically reflect in real-time thanks to Next.js’ fast refresh.

This project also uses next/font
 to automatically load and optimize Geist, Vercel’s modern font family.

🖼️ Using Pre-Prompts for Images
🧠 What Are Pre-Prompts?

Pre-prompts are predefined instructions given to the AI before generating or interpreting an image.
They act as a guide or context that tells the model how to think about the image request — ensuring consistency, style, and accuracy across all image generations.

💡 Why Use Pre-Prompts?

Pre-prompts help your app or bot generate more controlled, creative, and predictable results.
Instead of starting from scratch each time, the AI already understands your visual intent.

Key Benefits:

🎨 Consistent Style – Maintain the same color palette, tone, and artistic direction (e.g., “use soft lighting and cinematic framing”).

⚙️ Reduced Prompt Engineering – Users don’t have to craft detailed prompts; the system adds context automatically.

🧩 Improved Accuracy – Ensures the image matches your app’s purpose (e.g., educational diagrams vs. fantasy art).

⚡ Faster Generation – Pre-formatted structure reduces confusion and improves model response time.

🔒 Quality Control – Limits random or inappropriate outputs by setting creative boundaries.
